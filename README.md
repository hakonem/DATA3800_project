# DATA3800_project
## Final project for the subject DATA3800 Introduction to Data Science with Scripting

I devised a research problem which could be investigated with the help of data science, sourced a suitable dataset, analysed the data, and reflected on the outcome of the project.

This repository contains the dataset I used, the written report I submitted (as a Jupyter notebook) and the PowerPoint I used in my oral presentation.

Final grade: A :grin:
